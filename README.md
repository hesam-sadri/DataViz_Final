# DataViz_Final
This is the repository for the final exam of the CS-710.

In this project I used a kaggle dataset on students performances in the test. I did 2 different analyzes, one on the relation between sex and the score and the other one
is about economic status and score. I believe these three variables (parents education levels,Lunch class and attending in prepration course) reflect the family economic
power status.

Please download and unzip the whole DataViz_Final repository. Open Students_Score.R file and run each part one by one to see each and all charts provided in my presentation.

Thanks.
